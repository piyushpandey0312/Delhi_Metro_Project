## Abstract
> A Metro System is one which helps us to maintain an organisational data regarding a metro system. Since it is very difficult to maintain a record of data items and  this information manually or in file system, we are creating a database for the complete management of resources and tasks of metro system. A Metro System database is one which is used for operational ease in place of traditional file system or Excel worksheets for information storage and retrieval with customized user queries implemented in SQL and is a fully functionally required software prototype with proper user interface and some random software engineering standards. Organising database for data collection and retrieval helps us to maintain data easily. We design it with the help of Entity-Relationship diagram, UML diagrams, data flow diagrams, and using tables & proper User interfaces. It consists of several steps to be followed and many webpages are to be maintained simultaneously. It is a working prototype of a database schema which can further be enhanced. The usage of standard webpages in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP helps us to take project online without much modifications.

> For main functionalities, we have to maintain many records such as train numbers, train route, departure time, arrival time, train type, fare, managements, departments, customers, etc. When we want to travel we reserve seat (Additional feature for Metro System but it is not compulsory for all passengers to reserve seats for them, they can still check in at last moment in case of availability in first in first serve order), for this we have to fill the reservation form which includes entries such as train number, train name, departure time, arrival time, route, train type. So, we should gather all the information regarding all these.

## Preface
This project titled Metro System Database Project is one of the academic projects we (as a team of 2 members) take in DataBase Management System Laboratory course (4th Sem) of Bachelor in Technology (Computer Science & Engineering), here at Maulana Azad National Institue of Technology, Bhopal. This project was started in End of February 2018 and merely ends at the submission date by April 13. (Work in off days only)

The complete report is organized into small chapters, sections, subsections, appendices, etc. Snapshots and screenshots are taken for clear idea of what’s going. We’ve tried to cover all information regarding project to be assemble in report but still SRS document, Plan document, Design document, Preliminary RMMM plan does not find their place in the report. Further they can be merged into report in future as per requirements.

The foundations of project started in January 18, when new session starts and topic of project decided. Some points such that project management, scalability, risk analysis, version control, aims, etc. were discussed primarily. The major aims set at beginning of this project was-

- To gain the technical knowledge and experience and practical "hands" behind databases, their management systems, and other technologies.

- A clear idea of working title; incorporating traditional accent but with some modern software engineering principles, practices, and standards.

- Improving team skills under fully supervision (Project management including risk analysis and soft-skills).

- To present a final result implementation, its analysis, and evaluation with proper documentation/project report.

Althrought the aims were set primarily and broadly, we as a team collaborate on multiple issues and try as much as we can to be stick on aims along with healthy communication from supervisors. The documentation is neither a fully formal documentation nor a research based report, but it inherits many attributes of both in it. Here are some highlights of the project -

- A single document having combination of documentation, project report, reference manual, tutorial, user manual for the output

- Practical implementation of DataBase System used for Metro system

-	Parallel implementation of DataBase in many DataBases platforms, here we used MySQL workbench and LibreOffice Base as major two platforms using SQL as major query language

-	Incorporation of Software Engineering elements such as principles, practices, life-cycle, etc. 

Most of the collected contents are properly referenced*. If any of work is not, please feel free to notify us OR directly pull requests.

Everyone has authority to analyse, evaluate, and collaborate on this project. We will welcome all enthusiasts. This project is licensed under Creative Commons ShareAlike Non-distribution 3.0 International licence 2018. From software engineering practice we know Software prototype maintainance never ends as no software built is perfect, so the modifications to the first version/release of this project is completely moved to github. Althrough we are saying output as a software, it might not be a fully functional SOFTWARE. We can say it as a working prototype of software which can further be enhanced in form of a software.

It was very memorable to work on such a project with such a team and such a mentor. No work is perfect, remember to write your views to us! Healthy critism, suggestions, feedback, and even your opinions are always welcome to enhance this project either at github. It will be good if it includes its internal responsive filter search, thats why it is in To-do list.
